        <h3>Hello, and Welcome. This is PLANTplanIT!</h3>
        <p>So you are probably curious as to what "PLANTplanIT" is right? Well for time sake the inspiration behind it is that I wanted some where to go any easily be able to find plants for my garden, hence the name. It can also be used for other matters whether that be for a research paper, landscaping plans, trying to find out if that crazy itch that won't go away happened because you didn't realize you walked bare foot into a patch of poison ivy. Don't worry we got you. Our archive lists includes flowers, trees, bushes, and more.</p>
